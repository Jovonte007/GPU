# 🧿 CGPU: Cyclotronic Graphics Processing Unit

## 🔮 Vision
A GPU reimagined as a spiral-rendering eye — integrating rotational image retention, thermoelectric cooling, and eddy-current voltage amplification. Designed for symbolic rendering, planetary feedback, and heat-to-power transmutation.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔄 Spiral Rendering Engine
- Circular data focus mimics biological vision
- Rotational buffer increases image retention and render speed
- Cyclotron-inspired architecture enables parallel orbital processing

### 🌡️ Thermoelectric Cooling System
- Bismuth Telluride layered on copper base
- Titanium connector ports channel heat into voltage
- Eddy currents induced by magnetic rotation eliminate fan dependency

### 🌀 Cyclotron Integration
- Magnetic spin arrays replace traditional fans
- Generates airflow and stabilizes thermal zones
- Enhances rendering precision through centripetal data flow

## ⚙️ Materials & Components

| Material           | Function                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Bismuth Telluride  | Thermoelectric conversion (heat → power)  |
| Copper             | Heat distribution and conductivity        |
| Titanium Ports     | Voltage channeling + EMI shielding        |
| Cyclotron Array    | Rotational rendering + airflow generation |

## 🧬 Symbolic Mapping

- **Eye of the machine**: CGPU sees through spiral logic
- **Heat as memory**: Every degree becomes a data point
- **Rotation as retention**: Images orbit before release
